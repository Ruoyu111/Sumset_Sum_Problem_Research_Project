# Sumset_Sum_Problem_Research_Project

## Abstract

This project focused on researching the famous optimization problem: Subset Sum Problem. Subset Sum problem is easy to state and widely applicable. It is NP-Complete. Researchers have studied this problem for many years. In this project, we begin by developing a benchmark for this problem. The benchmark contains several sets of instances each with different size and
value. Then varies of optimization techniques/algorithms were developed and implemented for solving instances of the problem and apply them to the benchmark. The algorithms include exhaustive algorithm, greedy algorithm, LP/ILP, Steepest Descent and Simulated Annealing. Results and effectiveness of all the algorithms will be discussed and compared in the report. Finally, this project helped us learn everything there is to know about the computational solution of subset sum problem.

## Problem Description

The problem could be expressed in both decision and optimization version. First, it could be described as a decision problem: Given a set of positive integers S and a target value T, is there any subset of S which has a sum equals to T? It is assumed that the input set S is unique, no duplicates are presented. Second, the optimization version of Subset Sum problem is as follows: Given a set of positive integers S and a target value T, find a largest integer t such that t <= T and there is a subset of S with sum equals to t.
